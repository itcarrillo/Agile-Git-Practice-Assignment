## What's interesting about the article

The article provides great insight into why
different teams and different programmers
use different programming styles––both on 
the more vane, visual aspect, to the
functional aspect. I found interesting that
it claims that most of the differences are
due to the environment––big company vs small
company––and to the existence of influential
"10x" developers.

## Nicolas Lopierre Aguirre's comments

I think that from my experience in both startups and corporate, I can very much relate to both styles and validate the claim on how each one works. Personally, I prefer the startup, small company style since I would rather build something in sprints that deliver a new product and test it right away, without having to ask permission to three departments above.
